# Agentic-Trip-Planner
This project builds an AgentsVille trip planner using role-based prompts, chain-of-thought, ReAct cycles, and feedback loops. You’ll define trip info, analyze weather and activities, generate and evaluate itineraries, use tools for costs and event data, revise plans with ReAct, ensure two activities per day, and finish with a narrative summary.
