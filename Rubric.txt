Rubric
Use this project rubric to understand and assess the project criteria.
General Prompt Design
Criteria	Submission Requirements
Design a system prompt that effectively guides the LLM to produce a comprehensive, structured itinerary.	The prompt in ITINERARY_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT satisfies the following:
	• Clearly instructs LLM to assume a role as a travel planner, travel agent, or something similar
	• Encourages detailed daily plans through Chain-of-Thought guidance or examples.
	• Specifies JSON output format matching the TravelPlan Pydantic model structure.
	• Provides necessary context, including VacationInfo object, weather data, and activities data
Design a system prompt that determines whether an event should be avoided due to weather conditions	The prompt in ACTIVITY_AND_WEATHER_ARE_COMPATIBLE_SYSTEM_PROMPT satisfies the following:
	• Clearly defines the LLM role and task
	• Specifies exact output format
	• Includes relevant examples illustrating expected evaluations
Agent Reasoning and Tool Use
Criteria	Submission Requirements
Design a tool description that guides the LLM to call it when needed	The docstring for the get_activities_by_date_tool function should:
	• provide sufficient description for understanding tool’s purpose and use and
	• define expected input parameters and their data types and formats.
Design a prompt that guides an LLM to use reasoning and tools in the ReAct cycle	The prompt ITINERARY_REVISION_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT should satisfy the following:
	• Clearly states LLM role and itinerary revision task.
	• Details the THINK-ACT-OBSERVE cycle explicitly.
	• Lists all available tools, their purposes, and parameter requirements (adding this dynamically is nice, but not required).
	• Specifies exact ACTION format for tool invocation: {"tool_name": "[tool_name]", "arguments": {"arg1": "value1", ...}}
	• Includes explicit exit instruction via final_answer_tool invocation.
	• States that the run_evals_tool must be run before the final_answer_tool
Structured Output Validation
Criteria	Submission Requirements
Pydantic models are created and used properly	The VacationInfo Pydantic model is:
	• created properly given the JSON structure representing the travelers and their vacation details
	• is read properly (start and end dates) when pulling the weather and activity data
	The TravelPlan Pydantic model's schema is:
	• included in AT LEAST ONE system prompt that needs to output a TravelPlan data structure (there are two such prompts, so it is best, but not required, to include this schema in both of them)
