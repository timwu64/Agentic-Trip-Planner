    "# AgentsVille Trip Planner - Project Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll implement an AI system to help you plan a trip--to the wonderful city of AgentsVille!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your AI system will demonstrate advanced LLM reasoning techniques including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Role-Based Prompting** - Your agent will act as a specialized travel planner\n",
    "2. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning** - Step-by-step planning of itineraries\n",
    "3. **ReAct Prompting** - Thought → Action → Observation cycles\n",
    "4. **Feedback Loops** - Self-evaluation using tools in the ReAct loop to find mistakes and improve plans\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll simulate external API calls to gather weather data and activities. Then, process this information to create personalized travel itineraries based on interests and other constraints. Last, you'll implement a feedback loop to refine the plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build a travel agent that can plan the perfect AgentsVille vacation!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps you'll follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Vacation Details**\n",
    "    - Specify the trip duration, interests, and constraints.\n",
    "    - Use Pydantic to structure and verify this information in a class called `VacationInfo`.\n",
    "2. **Review Weather and Activity schedules**\n",
    "    - Simulate API calls to gather weather data and available activities in bulk\n",
    "    - Review the data manually to understand the available options\n",
    "3. **The ItineraryAgent**\n",
    "    - Implement an agent that generates a day-by-day itinerary based on the vacation details\n",
    "    - The system prompt will guide the agent's reasoning through a step-by-step planning process to take travel preferences (e.g. destination, dates, interests) and generate a detailed day-by-day itinerary\n",
    "    - Craft the components of the prompt (including the role, task/instructions, output format, examples, and context) to elicit the best possible itinerary in one LLM call\n",
    "4. **Evaluating the Itinerary**\n",
    "    - Evaluate the itinerary using a set of criteria to ensure a high-quality travel plan\n",
    "        - For instance, does the itinerary match the city and the dates requested?\n",
    "        - Or, is the total cost calulation accurate and is it within budget?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent hallucinate any activities that are not available?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent suggest activities that are not suitable for the weather? This specific evaluation function will require the use of an LLM to compare the event description against the weather data.\n",
    "5. **Defining the Tools**\n",
    "    - We will define four tools to assist the agent\n",
    "        - **calculator_tool**: to accurately calculate costs\n",
    "        - **get_activities_by_date_tool**: to retrieve activities for a specific date\n",
    "        - **run_evals_tool**: to evaluate the itinerary against the criteria\n",
    "        - **final_answer_tool**: to provide the final answer in a structured format\n",
    "6. **The ItineraryRevisionAgent**\n",
    "    - We will implement a second agent that revises the itinerary based on feedback using the ReAct THOUGHT → ACTION → OBSERVATION cycle.\n",
    "        - The LLM will first generated a THOUGHT / ACTION message, which contains reasoning steps and a tool call invocation.\n",
    "        - The Python code will parse the tool call and execute it, returning the result as a string to the LLM in an OBSERVATION message.\n",
    "        - After this cycle repeats n number of times, the LLM will invoke the final_answer_tool to signal to the Python code to end the loop and return the final answer.\n",
    "    - This agent will also **incorporate feedback on the initial itinerary** from the travelers to ensure the final plan has **at least 2 activities per day**. A new evaluation function using a powerful LLM will be created to check this user feedback.\n",
    "    - The agent will use the tools above to refine the plan iteratively, checking the weather and available activities, and ensuring the itinerary meets all constraints.\n",
    "7. **Something just for fun!**\n",
    "    - To wrap things up we'll create a fun, narrative summary of the trip, highlighting the best activities and experiences!"

       "Your upcoming trip to AgentsVille features two travelers, Yuri and Hiro. Yuri is 30 years old with interests in tennis, cooking, comedy, and technology, while Hiro is 25 and enjoys reading, music, theatre, and art. The trip is scheduled from June 10th to June 12th, 2025, with a total budget of 130 units, and the planned itinerary comes in under budget at a total cost of 115 units. The selection of activities carefully reflects your combined interests and takes into account weather conditions to ensure a comfortable and engaging experience.\n",
       "\n",
       "On June 10th, the weather will be clear with a warm temperature of 31°C, ideal for outdoor activities mixed with indoor events. The day starts with the FutureTech Breakfast Meet-Up at The Innovation Atrium, where Yuri’s passion for technology will be well catered to in a lively setting that encourages networking and discovery of the latest trends. Later, the Serve & Savor: Tennis and Taste Luncheon combines Yuri’s interests in tennis and cooking, offering an energizing mixed experience of playing doubles and participating in a hands-on cooking workshop in an outdoor setting, perfect for enjoying the beautiful weather.\n",
       "\n",
       "The following day, June 11th, brings partly cloudy skies with a high of 34°C. An indoor event, the Tech Lunch & Learn: AI Frontiers at The Digital Atrium, is perfect for both Yuri and Hiro, blending technology, music, and innovation in an interactive lunchtime gathering. The evening features the Palette & Palate: Art Meets Cooking Experience, a creative and social event where Hiro’s love for art and Yuri’s culinary interests merge. This indoor event offers the chance to paint your own artistic creation and then participate in a cooking class inspired by those masterpieces, promising an expressive and enriching experience.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the final day, June 12th, thunderstorms are expected as temperatures cool to 28°C, so the itinerary wisely emphasizes indoor venues with flexible options in case of rain. The Soundtrack Picnic at the Starlight Amphitheater offers a delightful combination of movies and live music with an indoor backup plan to ensure the event goes on smoothly. Later that evening, the Tech & Film Fusion Night at the Virtual Reality Theater immerses you in a blend of cutting-edge sci-fi cinema and technology discussions, creating an exciting finale that speaks directly to Yuri’s technological interests and Hiro’s appreciation of movies.\n",
