AgentsVille Trip Planner The Scenario
The Scenario: Your Adventure in AgentsVille Awaits!
Imagine a traveler, eager to explore the unique (though entirely fictional) city of AgentsVille. They have a set of preferences – perhaps a long weekend focused on art galleries and technology meetups, or a week-long dive into cultural experiences and street food, all within a specific budget. They turn to your AI-powered Trip Planner for help.
Your challenge is to build an AI system that can:
1. Understand and Interpret: Take into account user preferences and constraints.
2. Plan Comprehensively: Generate a detailed, day-by-day itinerary that is not just a list of activities, but a coherent plan tailored to the individual travelers.
3. Evaluate and Enhance: Refine the itinerary by intelligently using a set of tools to evaluate the plan, fetch new information, and refine the schedule.
This isn't just about getting an LLM to output text; it's about designing a system that reasons, plans, and interacts with "external" information sources to provide a truly helpful trip planning experience.
Project Description: Building Your AI Travel Assistant
Your "AgentsVille Trip Planner" will be a Jupyter Notebook application that orchestrates interactions with a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform two main functions:
1. The Expert Planner (Initial Itinerary Generation):
• Your Task: Based on a set of user-defined travel preferences (destination, duration, interests, budget), you will prompt the AI to act as an expert travel planner.
• The Outcome: The AI must generate a detailed, day-by-day travel itinerary for AgentsVille. This itinerary needs to be a structured JSON object that conforms to a predefined Pydantic model. This stage will heavily rely on your ability to craft prompts that elicit complex, structured output, guiding the LLM through a planning process.
2. The Resourceful Assistant (Itinerary Enhancement with a Tool-Using ReAct Agent):
• Your Task: Once an initial itinerary is generated, the user might have follow-up questions or request modifications. Additionally, we may have other requirements to satisfy before finalizing the itinerary. You will design an "AI Travel Assistant".
• The Outcome: This agent will analyze the user's request in the context of the current itinerary. It will then decide if any of its available "tools" — like calling the simulated activities API tool — can assist.
• If a tool is needed, the agent will THINK about its plan and ACT by generating a structured request for the tool.
• Your Python code will simulate the tool's execution and provide the result back to the agent as an OBSERVATION.
• The agent will then use this observation to continue its reasoning or formulate a final, helpful answer to the user.
