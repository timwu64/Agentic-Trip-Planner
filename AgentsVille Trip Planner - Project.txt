AgentsVille Trip Planner – Project Assignment

In this project, you will build an AI system capable of planning a complete trip to the fictional city of AgentsVille. The system demonstrates advanced LLM reasoning methods including:

1. Role-Based Prompting, where the agent behaves as a specialized travel planner.
2. Chain-of-Thought reasoning, where itineraries are constructed step-by-step.
3. ReAct prompting, using a Thought → Action → Observation cycle.
4. Feedback loops, where the agent evaluates its own work using tools and corrects errors.

The solution simulates external API calls for weather and activities, processes these data sources, and produces personalized itineraries that respect interests, constraints, and the environment. The goal is to produce a refined itinerary that is accurate, complete, and aligned with user needs.

Project Instructions

1. Define vacation details
   Specify trip duration, traveler interests, and constraints. Use a Pydantic model called VacationInfo to validate and structure the inputs.

2. Review weather and activity schedules
   Simulate API calls to gather weather forecasts and all available activities for the trip dates. Review these manually to understand the real options your planner can choose from.

3. Implement the ItineraryAgent
   This first agent generates a full day-by-day itinerary using the vacation details.
   The system prompt for this agent must guide reasoning, specify the output format, and ensure the result matches the TravelPlan Pydantic model.

4. Evaluate the itinerary
   Run a series of evaluations to verify quality. These checks ensure:
   • The itinerary uses the correct city and dates
   • The total cost is calculated correctly and respects the budget
   • No activities are invented or hallucinated
   • Activities incompatible with weather are flagged using an LLM-based evaluation function that reads event descriptions and weather data

5. Define the tools
   The system uses four tools during planning and refinement:
   • calculator_tool, for cost calculations
   • get_activities_by_date_tool, for retrieving activities on specific dates
   • run_evals_tool, for validating the itinerary
   • final_answer_tool, for returning the final structured result

6. Implement the ItineraryRevisionAgent
   A second agent revises the itinerary using the ReAct pattern.
   It generates a combined THOUGHT and ACTION message, where the ACTION triggers a tool call. Python executes the tool and returns the result to the LLM as an OBSERVATION.
   The agent repeats this cycle multiple times until the plan is corrected.
   It must also incorporate traveler feedback to ensure at least two activities per day, and use the new evaluation function to verify this requirement.
   Before completing, this agent must run run_evals_tool one final time and then call final_answer_tool to exit the loop.

7. Add something fun
   Conclude by generating a narrative summary of the trip, highlighting major experiences and activities in a storytelling format.
